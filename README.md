## 🍁🍁🍁 Project Title: Canada Superstore Sales & Profitability Analysis.

### 🎯 The Goal 
To analyze sales performance and identify specific "profit leaks" across the Canadian provinces and territories.

### 📂 Data Source 
I utilized a dataset containing transaction records for a major Canadian retailer spanning four years.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
Microsoft Excel, featuring Advanced Pivot Tables, Power Query, and Conditional Formatting.



## 🧹🧹 Data Cleaning and Analysis
I handled missing values and ensured consistent formatting for dates and currency to ensure accurate time-series analysis

### Pivot Table Logic
I created a dedicated "Calculations" sheet to isolate specific KPIs such as Monthly Trends, Regional Performance, and Product-level Profitability.

### 🌟Insight Discovery
By applying conditional formatting to monthly trends, I was able to visualize seasonal performance dips that were not immediately obvious in the raw data.
I identified specific months (June/September) with lower margins, prompting a deeper dive into regional "Risk Areas."

### 📈 Visualization
I built a specialized dashboard focusing on "Sales Performance Overview" and "Revenue Performance and Risk Areas" particularly to highlight exactly where the business is losing value and communicate findings to stakeholders quickly.


## 💡💡 Primary Findings
Total sales for the period reached $14.9M CAD, but net profit was heavily impacted by losses in specific sub-categories.

### 🚨 Regional Risk 
The Ontario and Quebec regions exhibited the highest sales volume but also the most significant "leakage," with top underperforming products causing about $99k loss.

### 📌📌 Recommendation 
I recommend a strategic review of the "Furniture" sub-category logistics in Central Canada to mitigate these losses.
